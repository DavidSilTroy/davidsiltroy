### Hey! I am 
# davidsiltroy

- Mechatronic Engineer graduated at UTN, Ecuador. 
- Applied Computer Science student at Thomas More, Belgium.
- Knowledge hunter.
- Friend.
- Always trying to leaving the world better than I found it.

I enjoy working in the programming field and always find it exciting to realize ideas with software. And sometimes with hardware (the mechatronic side). Feel free to check out all my repository, I am lucky to have worked with great people too! Not only other programmers but awesome designers!
