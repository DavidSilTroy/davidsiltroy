# davidsiltroy

- Mechatronic Engineer graduated in UTN, Ecuador. 
- Applied Computer Science student in Thomas More, Belgium.
- Knowledge hunter.
- Friend.
- Always trying to leaving the world better than I found it.

 I love to work in the programing word, always exited to make ideas come true with the software. And sometimes with hardward(the Mechatronic side). Feel free to see all my repository, I am lucky I have worked with awesome people too! Not only other programmers but awesome designers!
